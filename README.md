# Kun Han

My name is Kun Han. My bachelor in China was pharmacy and studied a master degree in statistics at Dalarna University. 

I have experience in accounting, import and export works, and also been a teacher of MA/NO at school for couple of years.

I am interested in data science and statistical modeling. I believe the artificial intelligence and machine learning will lead me into a new world of the future.
